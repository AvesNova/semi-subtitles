00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,970
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

{\an8}EPISODE 1

3
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,570
100 PERCENT PURE CARBONIC ACID

4
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,823
THIS IS THE TASTE OF TRUE BEER

5
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,769
Yes. The story will be published shortly,
at around 7 a.m.

6
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,565
But I said to <i>Despatch,</i> "Interlocking
fingers doesn't mean they're dating.

7
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,608
Ask anyone you see on the streets."

8
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,902
And if you look closely,
they aren't interlocked.

9
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,071
You're holding his wrist.

10
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,366
So I said, "They're obviously not dating."
I strongly denied it,

11
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,744
and we concluded that you two
are good friends who like to pull pranks.

12
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,081
You call that a prank?

13
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,459
Yes. I told them you two are very close
and that's how you usually fool around...

14
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,712
I mean, that's how
you two usually hang out.

15
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,224
THOSE TWO ARE DEFINITELY DATING

16
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,020
Right.

17
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,813
We were close.

18
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,357
Although it's all over now.

19
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,323
PLEASE LET ME JUST GO HOME

20
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:19,949
All right.

21
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,911
It already happened, so it's fine.

22
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,454
It's all good,

23
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,041
but can you do something
about the blur effect?

24
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,419
Should I tell them to blur your face more?

25
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,714
No, that's not what I'm saying.

26
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,800
They blurred my earrings too.

27
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,346
It's the accessory item I'm promoting
the hardest out of the whole collection.

28
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,723
The blur effect should be...
How shall I put this?

29
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,685
Can they carefully shrink it
so that the earrings show right away?

30
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,105
Actually, a full shot would be better.

31
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,191
That way, people can see my purse

32
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,817
-and shoes too.
-Got it.

33
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,697
Purchasing Manager.
What should you do, then?

34
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,116
-Pardon me?
-The earrings, purse, and shoes.

35
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,618
You need to secure enough stock.

36
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,412
Orders will pile up
when they start trending.
